Hi folks,

I have been looking for a way to document and share things that I'm learning. It's a great way to make things stick, and provides a resource for my reference in the future.

To that end, I'm rebooting this personal website. It will soon include things that I find interesting in and out of tech. Look out for more content in the future.

James

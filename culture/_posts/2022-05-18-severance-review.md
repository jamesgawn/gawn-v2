An onion sci-fi thriller. It reveals layer after layer until reaching a seat gripping season finale.

I had watched the trailer, but otherwise didn't know much about Severance going in. I would recommend this approach, so if you've not watched it yet, what are you waiting for.

# Highlights
* Exploring the ethical implications of "severance" through the eyes of Helly.
* The visual and audio aesthetic. You can't quite pin it down to a particular timeperiod, but it has a undefinable appeal.
* The questions still not answered. I felt closure at the end of the series, but there was plenty of unknowns left to debate over, and explore in future seasons.

# Lowlights
* It feels like a long time until we'll get move of this fantastic series.

# Recommendation
This is must watch TV for anyone who enjoys either Scifi or Thrillers.

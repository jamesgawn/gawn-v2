I watched this performance at the Royal Opera House, London on the Saturday 6th January.

# Highlights
Rigoletto’s costume a cross between Duke Baron Harconan from David Lynches Dune and Bill Bailey
Staging inspired by the most recent mad max film

Musical pace slackened after the opening scene before picking up at the end of the act
Historically inaccurate Vulux window in Rigoletto’s house

  A review of the must see, sell your first born to see it, performance of Salome at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.
---

I watched this performance at the Royal Opera House, London on the Sunday 21st January.

# Highlights
Stunning set of staging changes for the Dance of the Seven Veils sequence.
A brief pre-performance appearance by Mr and Mrs mouse. I can only assume they are cultured mice.

# Lowlights
I was left completely baffled why the soldier had to strip naked to kill another character.
Kateâ€™s Comment
